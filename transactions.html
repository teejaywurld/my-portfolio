        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This case study highlights the importance of user-centered design in improving 
            a Mobile's effectiveness and achieving financial goals. This savings platform 
            is a financial tool that allows users to deposit and save their money while 
            earning interest on their savings. It is a convenient and secure way to save 
            money for various financial goals, such as emergencies, future expenses, or 
            long-term investments. The primary focus here is to encourage the users to save 
            and provide them with the flexibility of withdrawing when needed.

      <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            With the increasing complexity of personal finances and the evolving needs of 
            individuals, there is a lack of user-friendly and technologically advanced 
            savings platforms that offer a seamless and comprehensive solution for efficient 
            money management, goal tracking, and maximizing savings potential. Building a 
            savings platform that addresses these challenges would provide individuals with 
            a user-friendly, intuitive, and technologically advanced solution to effectively 
            manage their finances, improve savings habits, track progress towards goals, and 
            enhance their financial well-being, that is where HAG savings platform comes in.

      <h2>Design Approach</h2>
        <p>
            In creating a successful financial app, it is important to balance aesthetics and 
            functionality while ensuring that the designs are accessible, providing affordances 
            that address user needs. I achieved this by combining intuitive navigation, 
            high-quality visuals, and personalized and goal-oriented features. While creating 
            these designs, I drew inspiration from similar products like Sumo trust app, Kuda 
            app, carrying out design processes like, using brainstorming techniques, user flows, 
            user journey maps, and other ideation methods to explore different possibilities. 
            The colors were carefully selected to provide the feeling of Calmness, Security and 
            Reliability

      <h2>Low Fidelity Designs</h2>
        <p>
          As part of my design process I created low-fidelity designs to quickly visualize and 
          communicate ideas. Focus on representing key features and functionalities rather than 
          perfecting details.

      <h2>High Fidelity Designs</h2>
        <p>
          The design for this savings mobile app focuses on the user experience of prospective 
          customers. A registered user would be prompted to login, in order to gain full 
          experience and control of what happens within the app. Email and Password are the media 
          through which a user can login to HAG 301 Savings platform, but as a new unregistered user, 
          more information such as: Service number, address, fullname, etc. would be required to create 
          an account on the app.
